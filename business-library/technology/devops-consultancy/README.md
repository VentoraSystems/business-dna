## Description

A solo-deliverable DevOps consultancy built around fixed-scope
infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline overhauls: a single senior engineer
audits, migrates, and hands off a client's deployment pipeline using an
incremental, rollback-checkpointed plan, always closing with a mandatory
knowledge-transfer phase. Distinct from `it-managed-services` (continuous
office-IT operations) and `cybersecurity-consultancy` (security audits)
in this same `technology-services` category — this business improves an
engineering team's own deployment pipeline for their product, and unlike
either of those two, is genuinely solo-founder-deliverable.

## Translation keys

Every narrative field in `financial.json`, `marketing.json`,
`roadmap.json`, `resources.json`, and `business-insights.json` is a
`translationKey` under `businessLibrary.devopsConsultancy.*` in
`messages/en.json` and `messages/ro.json`. `business-dna.json`'s
narrative fields are inline bilingual `{ en, ro }` objects instead, per
`features/business-dna`'s own (frozen) schema convention.
