## Description

A visual, drag-and-drop workflow builder that lets non-technical
operations, marketing, and customer-success teams chain AI action
blocks (summarize, classify, generate, extract) together with native
integrations into tools like Slack, Gmail, Airtable, and HubSpot,
priced on seat-and-workflow-run subscription tiers. This is this
library's second `saas` business, after `ai-document-processing-saas`
— deliberately differentiated from it: a non-technical operations/
marketing buyer rather than a developer, a visual canvas product
rather than a developer-facing API, and a seat-plus-workflow-run
pricing model rather than per-document-volume usage pricing. Not
solo-friendly — building and maintaining a visual builder plus a
library of reliable third-party integrations requires a small founding
engineering team from day one.

## What's in this package

| File | Validates against |
|---|---|
| `metadata.json` | Package-level identity/status (`validate-packages.ts`'s required fields) |
| `business-dna.json` | `features/business-dna`'s `BusinessDnaProfile` schema |
| `blueprint.md` | Narrative document following `features/blueprint`'s v2 25-section outline |

| `marketing.json` | `features/marketing`'s `marketingSchema` (18 sections) |
| `roadmap.json` | `features/roadmap`'s `roadmapSchema` (10-stage v2 vocabulary) |
| `resources.json` | `features/resources`'s `resourcesSchema` (16-category canonical taxonomy) |
| `business-insights.json` | `features/business-insights`'s `businessInsightsSchema` (the "soft knowledge" layer) |

## Translation keys

Every narrative field in `financial.json`, `marketing.json`,
`roadmap.json`, `resources.json`, and `business-insights.json` is a
`translationKey` under `businessLibrary.nocodeAiWorkflowSaas.*` in
`messages/en.json` and `messages/ro.json`. `business-dna.json`'s
narrative fields are inline bilingual `{ en, ro }` objects instead, per
`features/business-dna`'s own (frozen) schema convention — except its
Section 18 `resources` list, which uses `translationKey` references into
`businessLibrary.nocodeAiWorkflowSaas.businessDna.resources.*`.
