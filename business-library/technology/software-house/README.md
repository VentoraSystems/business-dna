## Description

A custom software development studio built around fixed-scope project
delivery: a small, distributed engineering team builds bespoke products
and internal tools for funded startup founders and mid-market operations
leaders, always starting with a paid discovery sprint before quoting a
fixed price. Post-launch, delivered clients are converted into an ongoing
maintenance retainer. Distinct from `ai-automation-agency` (workflow/AI
automation implementation) and from this same `technology-services`
category's `web-development-agency` (templated, fast-turnaround web
builds) — this is bespoke engineering for problems a template can't solve.

## Translation keys

Every narrative field in `financial.json`, `marketing.json`,
`roadmap.json`, `resources.json`, and `business-insights.json` is a
`translationKey` under `businessLibrary.softwareHouse.*` in
`messages/en.json` and `messages/ro.json`. `business-dna.json`'s
narrative fields are inline bilingual `{ en, ro }` objects instead, per
`features/business-dna`'s own (frozen) schema convention.
