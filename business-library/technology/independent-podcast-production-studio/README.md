## Description

A full-service podcast production studio handling recording
coordination, editing, mixing, show notes, and distribution for
founder-led thought-leadership podcasts and brand-sponsored podcast
series, monetized through a one-time show-launch package plus an
ongoing per-episode production retainer. Distinct from the still-
unauthored `youtube-channel-production-agency` and
`branded-video-content-studio` candidates elsewhere in this category
— this business is audio-podcast-specific, not video.

## What's in this package

## Translation keys

Every narrative field in `financial.json`, `marketing.json`,
`roadmap.json`, `resources.json`, and `business-insights.json` is a
`translationKey` under `businessLibrary.independentPodcastProductionStudio.*`
in `messages/en.json` and `messages/ro.json`. `business-dna.json`'s
narrative fields are inline bilingual `{ en, ro }` objects instead, per
`features/business-dna`'s own (frozen) schema convention — except its
Section 18 `resources` list, which uses `translationKey` references into
`businessLibrary.independentPodcastProductionStudio.businessDna.resources.*`.
